The Butterfly Effect
A First Person Psychological Thriller
This is a design document for The Butterfly Effect, a first-person psychological thriller and puzzle game. The world has been corrupted by a disaster, and it's up to you to save it by going back in time.

The core of the game is its domino effect puzzle system. You must make a series of subtle, insignificant changes in the past, knowing that these tiny actions will cascade into massive, world-altering consequences in the present. Unlike other time-travel games, you can't just fix things directly; you must think like a cosmic detective, using stealth to carefully plan each move several steps ahead. Your goal is to find the perfect chain reaction that will lead you to the corrupt gods and create a better future.
