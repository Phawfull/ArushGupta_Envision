Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! 
This is a simple text-based game built with Python. Your goal is to guess the secret number the computer has picked, which is somewhere between 1 and 100. The game will give you hints after each guess to help you get closer.

Features
Interactive Menu: You can choose to start a new game, check your best score, or quit.

Smart Hints: The game won't just say "too high" or "too low." It'll tell you if you're a little close to the number to help you narrow it down.

High Score Tracking: The game remembers your best score for the current session, so you can try to beat your own record!

Error Handling: Don't worry if you type something wrong. The program will handle it and ask you to try again.

How to Play
When you first start, you'll see a simple menu.

Choose "Play a new game" to get started.
